# Wheel of Fortune - Proposal
By James Glendinning

# PURPOSE OF PROGRAM
My goal for this project is to adapt the famous gameshow Wheel of Fortune
into a python-built, text-based game. The player will be given a clue and
will guess enough letters to figure out what the winning phrase is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
# STORYLINE
You are a contestant on America's favorite game show, WHEEL OF FORTUNE!
Do your best, and you may win a significant cash prize!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
# THEME
The game will primarily use thematic elements from the real gameshow,
but will have its own personality and details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
# CATCHPHRASES
"WHEEL!!! .....OF!!! .....FORTUNE!!!"
"I'd like to buy a vowel!"
"Spin that wheel!"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
# TARGET USER
Target user is likely someone who is aware of how Wheel of Fortune works,
and would be aware of common phrases and sayings that would appear in
the game. However, I will include an optional tutorial that explains how
to play the game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED FEATURES
This program will require
    -A scoring system
    -Fuctional "letter-guessing" system
    -Player should be able to spin a wheel for a random result
    -Around 10-12 phrases, paired with their own clues

# NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES
I would like this program to also include
    -Multiple players who can take turns (Max. 3 players)
    -Some visual flair, despite being text based
